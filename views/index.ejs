                                 Harper Construction Company, headquartered in San Diego, brings over 42 years of local and national construction experience; with a reputation for delivering large and unique design-build projects ahead of schedule and on budget.  Our company has served clients and building owners for over four decades. In that time, we have found that the key to every project’s success is understanding the Owner’s needs and expectations and then exceeding those expectations.

                                 Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
